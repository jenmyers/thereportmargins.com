title: On 2015
---

One of the cornerstones of my life philosophy that there’s no information that can’t be processed effectively and enthusiastically in a list. I love lists. If I one day write my memoir, it could very well be a collection of lists, carefully ordered and poetically detailed. I’m not sure what in me responds to lists, but I know it’s there, and, as a result, one of my end-of-year traditions is a list of all the stuff that was good and/or notable in life over the past year.

For the sake of completeness, here’s my list from [2012](http://jenmyers.tumblr.com/post/39070407068/things-i-did-in-2012), [2013](http://jenmyers.tumblr.com/post/70291365131/things-i-did-in-2013) and [2014](http://thereportmargins.com/on-the-good-stuff.html).

And here’s the rundown of 2015:

- Travel! This year I traveled more just because I could and wanted to than I ever have in my entire life. I went to City Museum in [St. Louis](https://www.instagram.com/p/zGezUGvGvY/). I met [Salt Lake City](https://www.instagram.com/p/zna1HdvGtb/) for the first time. I returned to [New York City](https://www.instagram.com/p/0a_A2IPGlS/) and stayed in the shadow of the Empire State Building. I climbed around on some mountains in [Albuquerque](https://www.instagram.com/p/5kFSUuPGlN/) for my birthday. I chilled in [Orlando](https://www.instagram.com/p/63bllqvGiY/). I got a little bit acquainted with a sunny [Seattle](https://www.instagram.com/p/8Yajm7vGmh/). I hung out in [Philadelphia](https://www.instagram.com/p/9yP7LIvGub/) with some awesome women. I went to Canada for the first time, to lovely little [Ottawa](https://www.instagram.com/p/72usltvGhE/). And I went to Japan for the first time, and had fun in [Tokyo](https://www.instagram.com/p/-VxjbbvGgx/).
- I spoke at five conferences, my lowest number since I first began speaking—but every conference I spoke at was guided by values I believe in and people I trust, which seems like a good way to go about it.
- I completed one year as the Open Source Curriculum Director at [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com/).
- I became the Leadership Community Manager of [Girl Develop It](http://girldevelopit.com/).
- I led six [Code and Cupcakes](http://codeandcupcakes.net/) workshops. [I also created a crowdfunding campaign that successfully raised enough money to buy twenty Chromebooks for workshop use.](https://www.instagram.com/p/yPkDCxPGst/)
- I read 41 books. (I set a goal of 50, which I didn’t reach, even if I manage another one or two before the official end of the year, but considering I didn’t get serious about it until June, I’d say I still did pretty well. Next year’s goal is 100.)
- [I took my first filmmaking classes, and wrote a screenplay that became the class film project.](https://www.instagram.com/p/3xP5EjvGsa/)
- [I spent the night at the Field Museum.](https://www.instagram.com/p/yx58r5PGj_/)
- [I was on public radio—WBEZ, no less—for the first time.](https://www.instagram.com/p/2tx6PrvGho/)
- [I went to C2E2 as lady Joel Robinson.](https://www.instagram.com/p/18f-VFPGh-/)
- [I ate at Alinea.](https://www.instagram.com/p/4HbicUPGmJ/)
- I saw the restored _The Third Man_ on film in my favorite vintage movie theater. [Twice.](https://www.instagram.com/p/4wmkyaPGja/)
- I turned thirty-four years old.
- I completed a full year, and counting, of my weekly email newsletter, and wrote 31 newsletter essays.
- [I filled 3.75 journals.](https://www.instagram.com/p/4NdR3IvGk-/)

2015 was a year of processing, letting go and restarting all the things I thought I had already processed, let go of and restarted the year before. Turns out those things take time. But I came out on the other side eventually. I settled into my own skin. I got comfortable in my life. I started to set goals that weren’t just “get past something bad and/or difficult.” It was a nice change, and it has laid a promising foundation for the new year.

I hope your list is equally interesting and revealing, or at least instructional. And I hope a new adventure finds you, even if it’s not the adventure you expect.
